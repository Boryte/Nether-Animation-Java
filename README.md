# Nether-Animation-Java

I started playing with shaders and made this simple nether animation in plain java.
It requires FFMPEG to be installed and the images are exported as ppms. I prefer it over for example pngs because they're extremely easy to write , no compression, faster to generate, they're perfect for synthetic frames and feeding into ffmpeg.
Only downside is larger file size.
